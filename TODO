* teach util/get_image_date to convert from JD back to the normal time.

* ping is not a good indicator that the whole thing is working.
Add a check that pache is working on the choosen web server for the period search.

* Make sure to go to another period search server if the first one didn't work.

* Fix the memory leak in ./lc related to the linear trend subtraction

* More tests on M31

* range check for all STAR*[Pos*[i]]

* Transfer to double-precision star positions

* First try to plate-solve with guessed coordinates and retry without them if failed...

* Exclude faintest (and brightest?) stars from the list of constant stars!

* Test with bad images (a mixture of non-overlapping fields).

* util/sysrem2 segfault on PoD test data

* Support long filenames in ./lc display.

* Print amplitude in ./lc display.

* Filter on distance to the nearest nearly-saturated star/pixel?

* Check if it's OK to accept saturated stars for image matching?

* Do not try to guess gain if 'photocurve' is used for magnitude calibration???
Unless it is explicitly requested by user.

* inxi may not work (becase of lspci for example) - deal with it

* Non-interactive version of find_candidates

* Make SysRem run on very large datasets

* Deal with this:
which: no wwwget in (/home/kirx/mybin:/home/kirx/cod/wcstools-3.9.4/bin:/opt/sun-jre-bin-1.6.0.02/bin/:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/opt/bin:/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/gcc-bin/5.4.0:/usr/bin/cdsclient:/home/kirx/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin/:/usr/games/bin/)

* ./sextract_single_image should re-compute the source catalog if 
default.sex was changed after processing an image series.

* Pirint error message when requested to convert from TT back to UTC.

* Single-image cosmic ray/hot pixel filter?

* Image arithmetics with floating point images

* util/ccd/mk - do robust sigma-clipping before MEDIAN-combining images

* Ignore JD keyword if there is a comment "/Julian Date at start of exposure"

* Test on linux Mint

* Test CFITSIO after building

* Correct for differential extinction/flat-fielding problems while perfroming
absolute magnitude calibration using APASS.

* Make sure the narrow-field CCD test images can be plate-solved automatically

* Need support for sub-second timing in DATE-OBS. So far we are rounding to
1 sec due to the structure of struct tm (int tm_sec)
https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Broken_002ddown-Time.html

* Print "unknown key" message in lc and find_candidates

* Even more clear interpretation of the command line

* More flexible access from the command line to the match radius (to reduce
the number of incorrect matches)

* Filtering SExtractor detections on the ellipticity paramter (to eliminate
blends that were not deblended)

* Export lightcurves to AAVSO format.

* Parallelize create_data?

* ZScale image scaling in pgfv???
ftp://iraf.noao.edu/ftp/web/sites/list2/0476.html

* Make sure we are not malloc'ing 0-size arrays anywere

* Make sure the string passed to system() is never an empty string!

* Cancel selection for 'Z' and 'K' using right click

* Check exit status of all system() calls
